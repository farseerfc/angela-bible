Instructions on how to upgrade nsis ant task.

Obtain the most recent version of nsis ant task from:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsisant

Since the zip (at least with version 1.2) does not have a root directory,
create a versioned root directory (e.g. nsisant-1.2)
Unzip the file into this directory.

In the new directory, remove the following:
   api
   src

Change the references to the old directory to the new directory in the following files:
   build.xml

In SVN remove the old nsis directory.

For instructions on use see: http://nsisant.sourceforge.net
