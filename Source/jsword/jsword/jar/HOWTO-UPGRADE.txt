Instructions on how to upgrade Lucene from one version to another.

Obtain the most recent version of Lucene from
   http://lucene.apache.org

Unzip the binary file into the jar directory.
Copy the src zip into the new lucene directory.
Copy the needed contrib jars to the root of this directory.
These are:
   contrib/analyzers/common/lucene-analyzers
   contrib/analyzers/smartcn/lucene-smartcn
   contrib/snowball/lucene-snowball

In the new directory, remove the following:
   All the Javadoc jars (*/**/*-javadoc.jar)
   docs
   lib
   src (This could be zipped rather than downloading the src zip)
   All the WARs */**/*.war
   lucene-demos*.jar

Change the references to the old directory to the new directory in the build path.

In SVN remove the old Lucene directory.

If installing a x.9 release, look for deprecations and replace them.

How to upgrade jdom

Obtain the most recent version from
http://jdom.org

Uncompress the binary file into the jar directory.
Rename it from jdom to jdom-1.1.1 (or whatever the version is)
mv jdom-1.1.1/build/jdom.jar jdom-1.1.1/jdom-1.1.1.jar
Create the src zip file (or jar file, if you like)
cd jdom-1.1.1/src/java
zip -r ../../jdom-1.1.1-src.zip org

Delete everything but these two files, the license file and the readme.

Change the references to the old directory to the new directory in the build path.
