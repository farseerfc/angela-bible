<p>The swing section is in charge of turning the XML from the source
section into a screen view.</p>

<p>I am currently using LotusXSL to automatically turn the XML data into
HTML and display this using the JDK Swing HTML component. This will allow
me to generate custimizable views&nbsp; - so that an AV source can be
displayed like the AV is usually printed, and an NIV/NKJV source to have 
paragraph formatting etc. (Or even a more mix and match system)</p>

<p>I also use a component called BSH (BeanShell) to give me a scripting
environment to test code. This may become part of the final interface as
it provides a significant amount of power to the user.</p>

<p>The current display code is very rough though. I have not spent very
much time on it because I think that there are tools on the way out that
will significantly help Java GUI development.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've stopped working on this package at the moment to concentrate on
other sections. I am noting idea that I come across though.</p>

<p>Things to try:</p>

<pre>
table.setAutoResizeMode(JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_OFF);
table.getColumnModel().getColumn(index).setPreferredWidth(width);
table.sizeColumnsToFit(-1);
</pre>
