Release process:

Step 1: Update the application's release number

On a Major release update the second number, on a minor change the third.
The first gets changed if there is a super major change.
Pretend that 1.0.9 is the next release number (because the current release is 1.0.8).
Change org.crosswire.bibledesktop.desktop.Msg.properties Desktop.Version=1.0.9
Ensure that the i18n variants of this file do not define Desktop.Version.
In the ant file common/core.xml change to <property name="release.version" value="1.0.9"/>
Update bibledesktop/etc/installer/win32/BibleDesktop.nsi PROCUCT_VERSION "1.0.9"
Update bibledesktop-web/src/web/download.html.

Step 2: Update the release files for the current jar names.
Update bibledesktop/etc/installer/macosx/info.plist
Update bibledesktop/etc/jnlp/bibledesktop.jnlp
Check in the changes for these 2 steps.

Step 3: Perform a clean build
Execute an ant build all in jsword-web. (jsword-web-ant-all in Eclipse)
Clean up all findbugs, pmd and checkstyle issues that make sense to do.
Fix any javadoc issues.
Check in any files that changed.
Re-execute the ant if any files changed.

Step 4: Build the Windows installer
Right click on bibledesktop/etc/installer/win32/BibleDesktop.nsis and compile the NSIS script.
Right click on bibledesktop/etc/installer/win32/BibleDesktopSetup.nsi and compile the NSIS script.
You need to be in Windows with NSIS installed.
This installer also requires the InetLoad plugin available here:
	http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InetLoad
	Out of that zip file, copy inetload.dll to the NSIS/plugins directory.
Verify that the installer works.
You can perform part of step 7 now.

Step 5: Build the MacOS X installer
Get bibledesktop-web/src/web/stable/BibleDesktop-v1.0.8.dmg
The BibleDesktop*.dmg will be reused, but renamed, as it laid out parts of the installer.
All we will be doing is replacing BibleDesktop.app in it.
Convert the dmg to read/write, mount and open it.
Copy the modified BibleDesktop.app into the opened, r/w disk image.
Eject the disk image.
Convert it to a compressed image and take the opportunity to rename it.
Save it into the bibledesktop/etc/installers/macosx directory, temporarily.
Don't check in the disk image.
Verify that the installer works.
You can perform part of step 7 now.

Step 6: Build the Linux installers
(None at this time)

Step 7: Copy the release files to stable
Delete all the jar, dmg, exe files in bibledesktop-web/src/web/stable
Run a nightly build, download it and copy it's files into bibledesktop-web/src/web/stable
Move the following to bibledesktop-web/src/web/stable
	From bibledesktop/etc/installer/macosx move BibleDesktop-v1.0.9.dmg
	From bibledesktop/etc/installer/win32 copy BibleDesktop.exe and move BibleDesktopSetup.exe
	From bibldesktop/etc/installers/rpm copy ??? (rpm and deb files)
Update bibledesktop-web/src/web/stable/bibledesktop-1.0.9.jnlp with the following
	codebase="http://www.crosswire.org/bibledesktop/stable"
	href="http://www.crosswire.org/bibledesktop"

Step 8: Clean checkout on the crosswire server
Log in to the crosswire server
Check ~jsword/bibledesktop/html/stable for the *1.0.9* files.
They should match the files listed in BibleDesktop.jnlp.
Remove any old or unused jars. This is important as they will otherwise be packaged via ant.
Put ~jsword/bin in your path.
Run ~jsword/bin/cleanCheckout.sh.
Run ~jsword/bin/build.sh all release.final
Check ~ftp/pub/jsword/release for the *1.0.9* files.
They should match the *1.0.8* files. Fix as needed.

Step 9: Verify the install.
Go to www.crosswire.org/bibledesktop/download.html
Check that the Mac installer works on a Mac.
Check that the Windows installer works on Windows, without Java and also with Java.
Check that Java WebStart works on a Mac, on Windows *or* on linux, with Java installed.

Step 10: Tag the release in svn
Wait a few days to see if there are any problems that need to be fixed.
If so, fix the problems and re-release with the same version number.
svn tag http://www.crosswire.org/svn/jsword/trunk http://www.crosswire.org/svn/jsword/tags/R1.0.9
