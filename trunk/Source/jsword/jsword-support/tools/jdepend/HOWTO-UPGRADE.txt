Instructions on how to upgrade jdepend.
Obtain the most recent version of jdepend from

Unzip the file into this directory.
In the new directory, remove the following:
   contrib
   docs

   src
   test

Change the references to the old directory to the new directory in the following files:

In SVN remove the old jdepend directory.

You may need to tell ant where to find the jdepend jar.
This varies by ide or whether ant is run standalone.
See build.xml for further info.

If you have copied the jdepend jar to ANT_HOME/lib,
you will want to delete the older one.
