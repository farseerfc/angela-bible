Instructions on how to upgrade checkstyle.

Obtain the most recent version of checkstyle from:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/checkstyle

Unzip the file into this directory.

In the new directory, remove the following:
   contrib/bcel
   contrib/examples
   contrib/hooks
   contrib/usage
   site
   build.xml
   all jars but checkstyle-all-*.jar

Change the references to the old directory to the new directory in the following files:
   build.xml

In SVN remove the old checkstyle directory.

Determine what has changed in checkstyle and update custom.xml appropriately.

You may need to tell ant where to find the checkstyle-all jar.
This varies by ide or whether ant is run standalone.
See build.xml for further info.

If you have copied the checkstyle-all jar to ANT_HOME/lib,
you will want to delete the older one.
