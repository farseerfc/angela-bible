  Enhancement request:

  If the instrumented application is run with the system property:
  "com.jcoverage.instrumentation.interval",
  then instrumentation will be written out to disk, every interval seconds.
  e.g.,
  java -Dcom.jcoverage.instrumentation.interval=30 com.example.LongRunningApp

  Initial work to support report engine callbacks to renderers

  Updates to documentation to include <check>.

ChangeSet@1.37, 2003-05-17 17:06:58+01:00, msparks@feanor.congreve.com
  The modified previouly uncommitted java file changes in the reporting engine, I hadn't commented.

ChangeSet@1.36, 2003-05-17 16:47:50+01:00, msparks@feanor.congreve.com
  Added notion of 'attributes' to reporting engine.
  Attributes have an information storing role, and will be used by renderers
  to extract data from the reports.
  
  Design note:
  Each report has a number of report items divided into categories.
  Report items take attributes, attribute classes are defined in each category.
  
  8 tests added to previous 9, making a total of 17
  Imposters used in one test, this usage will grow as report items are expanded.

ChangeSet@1.35, 2003-05-17 11:32:42+01:00, bk@quentin.sunninghill.org
  I have added a new tag <check> which can be used as part of an automated
  build process to ensure that the coverage level for the project is
  above a project defined minimum. For example:
  
      <check branch="80" line="80">
        <regex pattern="junit.framework.*" branch="85" line="90"/>
      </check>
  
  The above states that the default minimum branch coverage rate is 80% and
  that the default minimum line coverage rate is also 80%. There then follow
  zero or more <regex> tags which specify branch and line coverage rates for
  any class that matches the regular expression defined in "pattern".
  
  The intention is for <check> to fail the build process if the coverage
  level falls below the project minimum.
  
  For an example of <check> being used see samples/build.xml, and run:
  	ant clean junit

ChangeSet@1.32.1.1, 2003-05-16 18:00:12+01:00, msparks@feanor.congreve.com
  Added initial tests and design of the report module, part of the new reporting framework.
  The framework is used by the com.jcoverage.coverage.reporting.collation package.
  This is at an initial stage, and does not yet produce reports. That is for a future changeset to bring
  in the report renderers.
